# Smart Home using Apple HomeKit

This project uses [HomeSpan](https://github.com/HomeSpan/HomeSpan) which implements Apple HomeKit protocol for **ESP-32** family of boards.

This project can be extended to any number of fans, lights and drivers can be written to control any other devices.

> I made this as I was too lazy to get up and turn off the light before sleep :)
